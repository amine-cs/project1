# project1

In this project, use Python 3 to perform the following:

Have a command line application (in a terminal) output: "How many times?"

Then, have the computer prompt "What is your name?"

When the user enters the times and the name, output the name that was entered the number of times that was entered.

For example:

How many times? 3<br>
What is your name? Amine

Amine<br>
Amine<br>
Amine<br>
